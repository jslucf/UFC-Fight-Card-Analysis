A simulation and analysis a typical fight card using every UFC show from 1993 to January 2016.

I was recently watching a UFC show that started off with 7 straight fights that went to a decision. I was curious about how likely this was to occur again. This code takes the UFC dataset (which was scraped off Sherdog.com by some guy on Reddit in February 2016; I have attached CSVs) and then simulates a typical UFC show with N fights to find the probability of X number of finishes using hacker statistics. 

UPDATE (2/12/17): The initial code has now been updated to reflect this weekend's UFC 208 show which saw 9 decisions in 10 fights, a UFC record. According to my simulation model, this was a once in twenty-three year event! Some additional analysis was added at the end of the code to analyze other shows in UFC history with a high concentration of decision finishes.
