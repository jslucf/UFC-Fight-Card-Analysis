A simulation and analysis a typical fight card using every UFC show from 1993 to January 2016.

I was recently watching a UFC show that started off with 7 straight fights that went to a decision. I was curious about how likely this was to occur again. This code takes the UFC dataset (which was scraped off Sherdog.com by some guy on Reddit in 2016; I have attached CSVs) and then simulates a typical 12-fight show to attempt answer these questions using hacker statistics.
